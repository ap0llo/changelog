## Overview

ChangeLog is a tool to generate a change log based from a project's git history
using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

## Documentation

- [Getting started](./docs/getting-started.md)
- [Configuration](./docs/configuration.md)
- [Integrations](./docs/integrations.md)
- [Templates](./docs/templates.md)
- [Commandline Reference](./docs/commandline-reference/index.md)

## Building from source

ChangeLog is a .NET Core application. Building it from source
requires the .NET SDK 3.1 (version 3.1.100)

```ps1
dotnet restore .\src\ChangeLog.sln

dotnet build .\src\ChangeLog.sln

dotnet pack .\src\ChangeLog.sln
```

## Issues

If you run into any issues or if you are missing a feature, feel free
to open an [issue](https://github.com/ap0llo/changelog/issues).

I'm also using issues as a backlog of things that come into my mind or
things I plan to implement, so don't be surprised if many issues were
created by me without anyone else being involved in the discussion.

## Versioning and Branching

The version of the library is automatically derived from git and the information
in `version.json` using [Nerdbank.GitVersioning](https://github.com/AArnott/Nerdbank.GitVersioning):

- The master branch  always contains the latest version. Packages produced from
  master are always marked as pre-release versions (using the `-pre` suffix).
- Stable versions are built from release branches. Build from release branches
  will have no `-pre` suffix
- Builds from any other branch will have both the `-pre` prerelease tag and the git
  commit hash included in the version string

To create a new release branch use the [`nbgv` tool](https://www.nuget.org/packages/nbgv/)
(at least version `3.0.4-beta`):

```ps1
dotnet tool install --global nbgv --version 3.0.4-beta
nbgv prepare-release
```
